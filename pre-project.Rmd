# Practical Machine Learning

## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

## GOAL
  - The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. 
    - This is the "classe" variable in the training set.
  
  - You may use any of the other variables to predict with. 
  - You should create a report describing 
    - How you built your model
    - How you used cross validation
    - What you think the expected out of sample error is
    - Why you made the choices you did. 
    
  - You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases. 

## Paper Notes

Detect Mistakes

  - Class A: Exactly according to the specification.
  - Class B: Throwing the elbows to the front. 
  - Class C: Lifting the dumbbell only halfway.
  - Class D: Lowering the dumbbell only halfway.
  - Class E: Throwing the hips to the front.
  
For the Euler angles (roll, pitch and yaw) of each of the four sensors were calculated eight features:
- Euler angles (roll, pitch and yaw):
    - mean
    - variance
    - standard deviation
    - max
    - min
    - amplitude
    - kurtosis
    - skewness

Generating in total 96 derived feature sets: 17 features were selected: 
- In the belt, were selected:
    - the (1) mean and (2) variance of the roll,
    - (3) maximum, 
    - (4) range and (5) variance of the accelerometer vector,
    - (6) variance of the gyro and (7) variance of the magnetometer

- the arm, 
    - the (8) variance of the accelerometer vector 
    - and the (9) maximum and (10) minimum of the magnetometer were selected.
    
- In the dumbbell, the selected features were 
    - the (11) maximum of the acceleration, 
    - (12) variance of the gyro and 
    - (13) maximum and (14) minimum of the magnetometer, 
    
- while in the glove, 
    - the (15) sum of the pitch and the 
    - (16) maximum and (17) minimum of the gyro were selected.
